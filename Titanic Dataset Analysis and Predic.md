Titanic Dataset Analysis and Prediction
Overview
This project involves the analysis and prediction of passenger survival on the Titanic using a comprehensive approach. The focus is on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using the Titanic dataset. The project is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook, which includes all the steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

Features
Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values and ensuring data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.
Predictive Modeling:
Building and evaluating models to predict passenger survival.
Visualization:
Creating plots to enhance understanding of data and model performance.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the titanic_analysis.ipynb file.
Run the Notebook:
Execute the cells sequentially to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
Explore the Analysis:
The notebook includes detailed comments and markdown cells explaining each step, making it easy to follow the analysis and understand the results.
Key Sections of the Notebook
Importing Libraries:
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation, model building, and visualization.
Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values using appropriate techniques to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing the distribution of numerical and categorical variables.
Analyzing relationships between features using plots and correlation matrices.
Predictive Modeling:
Building models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict survival.
Evaluating the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
Visualization:
Generating visualizations to better understand data patterns and model performance.
Results
After running the notebook, you'll see:

Model Performance: Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix for each model.
Visualizations: Various plots that illustrate data distribution, feature relationships, and model performance.
